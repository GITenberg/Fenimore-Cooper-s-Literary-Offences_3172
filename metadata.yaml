description: "\"Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses\" is an 1895 essay by Mark Twain,\
  \ written as a satire and criticism of the writings of James Fenimore Cooper. Drawing\
  \ on examples from The Deerslayer and The Pathfinder from Cooper's Leatherstocking\
  \ Tales, the essay claims Cooper is guilty of verbose writing, poor plotting, glaring\
  \ inconsistencies, overused clich√©s, cardboard characterizations, and a host of\
  \ similar \"offenses.\"\nThe essay is characteristic of Twain's biting, derisive\
  \ and highly satirical style of literary criticism, a form he also used to deride\
  \ such authors as Oliver Goldsmith, George Eliot, Jane Austen, and Robert Louis\
  \ Stevenson.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
